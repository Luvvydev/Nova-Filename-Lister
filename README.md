# Nova Filename Lister

A tiny cross-platform GUI to list filenames from a folder, sort them, preview the result, and write to a text file. Built with Tkinter. Designed for a clean Nova Dark look with pastel pink and dark purple accents.

**Motivation**
* I made this to help sort a Minecraft mod list. You can use it for any folder that needs a quick, tidy list.
