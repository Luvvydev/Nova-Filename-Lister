# Nova Filename Lister

A tiny cross-platform GUI to list filenames from a folder, sort them, preview the result, and write to a text file.


**Motivation**
* I made this due to a request to help sort a Minecraft mod list. You can use it for any folder that needs a quick, tidy list.

---

## Features

* Pick a folder and output file name
* Include files, include folders, or both
* Optional recursion into subfolders
* Case insensitive or natural numeric sort
* Live preview pane
* One click write to `filenames_sorted.txt` or a custom name
* Theme picker with Nova Dark and Light
* Header logo text that reads **nova**
